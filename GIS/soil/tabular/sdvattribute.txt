In the database, some states maintain crop yield data by individual map unit component and others maintain the data at the map unit level. Attributes are included in this application for both, although only one or the other is likely to have data for any given geographic area. This attribute uses data maintained at the map unit component level.

The yields are actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value for the component. For these yields, only the representative value is used.

The yields are based mainly on the experience and records of farmers, conservationists, and extension agents. Available yield data from nearby areas and results of field trials and demonstrations also are considered.

The management needed to obtain the indicated yields of the various crops depends on the kind of soil and the crop. Management can include drainage, erosion control, and protection from flooding; the proper planting and seeding rates; suitable high-yielding crop varieties; appropriate and timely tillage; control of weeds, plant diseases, and harmful insects; favorable soil reaction and optimum levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements for each crop; effective use of crop residue, barnyard manure, and green manure crops; and harvesting that ensures the smallest possible loss.

40|"Lawns, Landscaping, and Golf Fairways"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"This interpretation rates soils for their use in establishing and maintaining turf for lawns and golf fairways and ornamental trees and shrubs for residential or commercial landscaping. Lawns and landscaping require soils on which turf and ornamental trees and shrubs can be established and maintained. Golf fairways are subject to heavy foot traffic and some light vehicular traffic. Cutting or filling may be required. 

The ratings are based on the use of soil material at the site, which may have been altered by some land smoothing. Irrigation may or may not be needed and is not a criterion in rating. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect plant growth and trafficability after vegetation is established. The properties that affect plant growth are reaction; depth to a water table; ponding; depth to bedrock or a cemented pan; the available water capacity in the upper 40 inches; the content of salts, sodium, or calcium carbonate; and sulfidic materials. The properties that affect trafficability are flooding, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, stoniness, and the amount of sand, clay, or organic matter in the surface layer. The suitability of the soil for traps, tees, roughs, and greens is not considered in the ratings.

Not considered in the ratings, but important in evaluating a site, are the location and accessibility of the area, the size and shape of the area and its scenic quality, vegetation, access to water, potential water impoundment sites, and access to public sewer lines. Soils that are subject to flooding are limited by the duration and intensity of flooding and the season when flooding occurs. In planning for lawns, landscaping, or golf fairways, onsite assessment of the height, duration, intensity, and frequency of flooding is essential.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use.

The properties used to evaluate the soil as a source of sand are gradation of grain sizes (as indicated by the Unified classification of the soil), the thickness of suitable material, and the content of rock fragments. If the bottom layer of the soil contains sand, the soil is considered a likely source regardless of thickness. The assumption is that the sand layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness. The ratings are for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 6 feet.

The soils are rated ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""poor"" as potential sources of sand. A rating of ""good"" or ""fair"" means that sand is likely to be in or below the soil. The bottom layer and the thickest layer of the soil are assigned numerical ratings. These ratings indicate the likelihood that the layer is a source of sand. The number 0.00 indicates that the layer is a ""poor source."" The number 1.00 indicates that the layer is a ""good source."" A number between 0.00 and 1.00 indicates the degree to which the layer is a likely source.

20|"Source of Reclamation Material"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Reclamation material is used in areas that have been drastically disturbed by surface mining or similar activities. When these areas are reclaimed, layers of soil material or unconsolidated geological material, or both, are replaced in a vertical sequence. The reconstructed soil favors plant growth. The ratings do not apply to quarries or other mined areas that require an offsite source of reconstruction material. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect erosion and stability of the surface and the productive potential of the reclaimed soil. These properties include the content of sodium, salts, and calcium carbonate; reaction; available water capacity; erodibility; texture; content of rock fragments; and content of organic matter and other features that affect fertility.

The soils are rated ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""poor"" as potential sources of reclamation material. The ratings are based on the amount of suitable material and on soil properties that affect the ease of excavation and the performance of the material after it is in place. The thickness of the suitable material is a major consideration. The ease of excavation is affected by large stones, depth to a water table, and slope. How well the soil performs in place after it has been compacted and drained is determined by its strength (as inferred from the AASHTO classification of the soil) and linear extensibility (shrink-swell potential). Normal compaction, minor processing, and other standard construction practices are assumed.

When the material is properly used in reclamation, a rating of ""good"" means that establishing and maintaining vegetation are relatively easy, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reclaimed soil has good potential productivity. A rating of ""fair"" means that vegetation can be established and maintained and the soil can be stabilized through modification of one or more properties. For satisfactory performance, it may be necessary to topdress with better suited material or add soil amendments. A rating of ""poor"" means that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and costly. To establish and maintain vegetation, it is necessary to topdress with better suited material.

Numerical ratings between 0.00 and 0.99 are given after the specified features. These numbers indicate the degree to which the features limit the soils as sources of reclamation material. The lower the number, the greater the limitation.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00.

103|"Daily Cover for Landfill"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Daily cover for landfill is the soil material that is used to cover compacted solid waste in a sanitary landfill. The soil material is obtained offsite, transported to the landfill, and spread over the waste. The ratings also apply to the final cover for a landfill. They are based on the soil properties that affect workability, the ease of digging, and the ease of moving and spreading the material over the refuse daily during wet and dry periods. These properties include soil texture, depth to a water table, ponding, rock fragments, slope, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, reaction, and content of salts, sodium, or lime.

Loamy or silty soils that are free of large stones and excess gravel are the best cover for a landfill. Clayey soils may be sticky and difficult to spread; sandy soils are subject to wind erosion.

Slope affects the ease of excavation and of moving the cover material. Also, it can influence runoff, erosion, and reclamation of the borrow area. 

The soil material used as the final cover for a landfill should be suitable for plants. It should not have excess sodium, salts, or lime and should not be too acid. After soil material has been removed, the soil material remaining in the borrow area must be thick enough over bedrock, a cemented pan, or the water table to permit revegetation. Some damage to the borrow area is expected, however, and plant growth may not be optimum.

This information is intended for land use planning, for evaluating land use alternatives, and for planning site investigations prior to design and construction. The information, however, has limitations. For example, estimates and other data generally apply only to that part of the soil between the surface and a depth of 5 to 7 feet. Because of the map scale, small areas of different soils may be included within the mapped areas of a specific soil.

The information is not site specific and does not eliminate the need for onsite investigation of the soils or for testing and analysis by personnel experienced in the design and construction of engineering works.

Government ordinances and regulations that restrict certain land uses or impose specific design criteria were not considered in preparing the ratings. Local ordinances and regulations should be considered in planning, in site selection, and in design.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected.

90|"Sanitary Landfill (Trench)"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"A ""trench sanitary landfill"" is an area where solid waste is placed in successive layers in an excavated trench. The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil excavated at the site. When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the landfill. A landfill must be able to bear heavy vehicular traffic. It can result in the pollution of ground water. Ease of excavation and revegetation should be considered.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the risk of pollution, the ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation. These properties include saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, flooding, texture, stones and boulders, highly organic layers, soil reaction, and content of salts and sodium. Unless otherwise stated, the ratings apply only to that part of the soil within a depth of about 6 feet. For deeper trenches, onsite investigation may be needed.

Hard, nonrippable bedrock, creviced bedrock, or highly permeable strata at or directly below the proposed trench bottom can affect the ease of excavation and the hazard of ground-water pollution. Slope affects construction of the trenches and the movement of surface water around the landfill. It also affects the construction and performance of roads in areas of the landfill.

Soil texture and consistence affect the ease with which the trench is dug and the ease with which the soil can be used as daily or final cover. They determine the workability of the soil when dry and when wet. Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and are difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of refuse.

The soil material used as the final cover for a trench landfill should be suitable for plants. It should not have excess sodium or salts and should not be too acid. The surface layer generally has the best workability, the highest content of organic matter, and the best potential for plants. Material from the surface layer should be stockpiled for use as the final cover.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected.

84|"Sewage Lagoons"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Sewage lagoons are shallow ponds constructed to hold sewage while aerobic bacteria decompose the solid and liquid wastes. Lagoons should have a nearly level floor surrounded by cut slopes or embankments of compacted soil. Nearly impervious soil material for the lagoon floor and sides is required to minimize seepage and contamination of ground water. Considered in the ratings are slope, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, large stones, and content of organic matter.

Ksat is a critical property affecting the suitability for sewage lagoons. Most porous soils eventually become sealed when they are used as sites for sewage lagoons. Until sealing occurs, however, the hazard of pollution is severe. Soils that have a Ksat rate of more than 14 micrometers per second are too porous for the proper functioning of sewage lagoons. In these soils, seepage of the effluent can result in contamination of the ground water. Ground-water contamination is also a hazard if fractured bedrock is within a depth of 40 inches, if the water table is high enough to raise the level of sewage in the lagoon, or if floodwater overtops the lagoon.

A high content of organic matter is detrimental to proper functioning of the lagoon because it inhibits aerobic activity. Slope, bedrock, and cemented pans can cause construction problems, and large stones can hinder compaction of the lagoon floor. If the lagoon is to be uniformly deep throughout, the slope must be gentle enough and the soil material must be thick enough over bedrock or a cemented pan to make land smoothing practical.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected.

A final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the completed landfill. A landfill must be able to bear heavy vehicular traffic. It can result in the pollution of ground water. Ease of excavation and revegetation should be considered.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect trafficability and the risk of pollution. These properties include flooding, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, slope, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan. Flooding is a serious problem because it can result in pollution in areas downstream from the landfill. If Ksat is too rapid or if fractured bedrock, a fractured cemented pan, or the water table is close to the surface, the leachate can contaminate the water supply. Slope is a consideration because of the extra grading required to maintain roads in the steeper areas of the landfill. Also, leachate may flow along the surface of the soils in the steeper areas and cause difficult seepage problems.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use.

Only that part of the soil between depths of 24 and 60 inches is evaluated. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect absorption of the effluent, construction and maintenance of the system, and public health. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and flooding affect absorption of the effluent. Stones and boulders, ice, and bedrock or a cemented pan interfere with installation. Subsidence interferes with installation and maintenance. Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in downslope areas.

220|"Septic Tank Absorption Fields (NY)"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Septic tank absorption fields are subsurface systems of perforated pipe or similar devices that distribute effluent from a septic tank into the soil. New York State Department of Health regulations allow installation of septic system absorption fields of varying designs, depending upon the depth of suitable soil material above any limitation in the natural soil at a site (New York State Department of Health, 1990). Where necessary, imported fill material may be used to elevate absorption trenches to at least the minimum distance of 24 inches above limiting soil horizons. The depth ranges of suitable material and corresponding types of absorption systems allowed are as follows:

Less than 12 inches-no system allowed
12 to 24 inches-alternative raised trench
24 to 48 inches-conventional shallow trench
More than 48 inches-conventional system

The ratings in this interpretation are based on evaluation of the soil between depths of 12 and 48 inches. In addition, the bottom layer of the soil is evaluated for risk of seepage. This interpretation does not evaluate bedrock below the soil. The soil properties and site features considered are those that affect absorption of the effluent, construction and maintenance of the system, and public health.

The soil properties and qualities that affect the absorption and effective treatment of wastewater effluent are saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a seasonal high water table, depth to bedrock, depth to dense material, and susceptibility to flooding. Stones and boulders and a shallow depth to bedrock or dense material interfere with installation. Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in downslope areas. In addition, the hazards of erosion and sedimentation increase as slope increases.

526|"Soil-Based Residential Wastewater Disposal Ratings (VT)"|"mapunit"|"vtsepticsyscl"|"Choice"|254||"This interpretation indicates the suitability of the soils for soil-based residential wastewater disposal systems. The ratings are based on the 2007 Vermont Environmental Protection Rules (Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, Agency of Natural Resources). This rating system replaces the system in the publication ""Ancillary Soil Interpretation Ratings for On-site Sewage Disposal in Vermont,"" published in January 1997 by the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

Included in soil-based wastewater disposal systems are absorption fields, also known as leach fields, or trenches in which effluent from a septic tank is distributed into the soil through subsurface tiles or perforated pipe. There must be unsaturated soil material beneath the absorption field to filter the effluent effectively. Unsatisfactory performance, including excessively slow absorption of effluent, surfacing of effluent, and hillside seepage, can affect public health.

The ratings are represented by symbols for five interpretive groups and their subgroups. These groups and subgroups are described in the following paragraphs.

Group I soils are well suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. Good performance and low maintenance can be expected. The soils in this group are sandy and gravelly soils that formed in outwash and that have rapid permeability in the substratum and well drained soils that formed in till and that have a friable substratum with moderate permeability. Slopes generally are less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ia have rapid permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ib have rapid permeability and slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ic have moderate permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Id have moderate permeability and slopes that range to more than 20 percent.

Group II soils are moderately suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. This group includes soils with moderately slow to very slow permeability; complexes in which one or more of the soils have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches); soils that would qualify for inclusion in group I but have slopes of more than 20 percent; and soils that have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 18 inches or more.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIa have moderately slow to very slow permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIb have moderately slow to very slow permeability and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIc have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches) in some areas and have slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IId have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches) and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIe have rapid permeability and have slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIf have moderate permeability and slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIh have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 18 inches or more and have slopes of less than 20 percent.

Group III map units are marginally suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. Intensive onsite investigation may be needed to locate suitable areas, or special design, extra maintenance, or costly alteration may be needed to overcome the soil-related limitations. In areas where the water table is at a shallow depth, seasonal onsite monitoring of the water table may be needed to determine whether the site is suitable. Some areas of any of the map units in group III may not be suitable for soil-based wastewater disposal systems.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIa have bedrock at a depth of less than 10 inches in some areas. Some map units are limited by slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIb are subject to flooding and have a seasonal high water table at a moderate depth.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIc have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 foot or less and have slopes of 8 percent or less.
     •   	Map units in subgroup IIId have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 foot or less and have slopes of 8 to 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIe generally have a seasonal high water table within a depth of 2 feet and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIf have a seasonal high water table and limited depth to bedrock. Some map units have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIg have a flooding hazard.

Group IV map units are generally not suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems because of such limitations as wetness, depth to bedrock, restricted permeability, and slope.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVa are subject to excessive wetness.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVb are limited by the depth to bedrock and by slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVc are generally not suited because of a very limited depth to bedrock and the slope.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVd have moderately slow to very slow permeability and have slopes of more than 20 percent. Some map units have a seasonal high water table.

Group V map units are not rated for soil-based wastewater disposal systems. This group includes miscellaneous areas that have been filled, excavated, regraded, or otherwise disturbed by human activities; areas that are mapped above the series level, such as Udorthents; and areas of water. The miscellaneous areas and the areas mapped above the series level have a wide range of soil properties. Onsite investigation is needed to determine the suitability of these areas for soil-based wastewater disposal.

These ratings are based on the installation of a new septic system for a new single-family home on a lot subdivided on or after June 14, 2002, in a municipality that has planning and zoning bylaws. The ratings do not necessarily apply to the siting of a replacement system for an existing residence. The ratings for lots subdivided before June 14, 2002, are based on a slope limitation of 30 percent, whereas the ratings in this interpretation are based on a slope limitation of 20 percent. The ratings in this interpretation do not take into consideration some site factors that can affect the placement of septic systems, such as wellhead and source protection areas, isolation distances, and the size of the parcel.
This interpretation is intended for general planning purposes only and is not intended to replace or supersede the need for an onsite soil investigation. These ratings apply only to land within the State of Vermont."|||"Property"||||1|0|0|0||0|||-1|"SBRWDR"||||||||0||||"Centimeters"|0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|2||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""2""><ColorRampType type=""2"" name=""Defined"" /><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""Ia"" label=""Ia"" order=""1""><Color red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Ib"" label=""Ib"" order=""2""><Color red=""44"" green=""188"" blue=""20"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Ic"" label=""Ic"" order=""3""><Color red=""27"" green=""118"" blue=""12"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Id"" label=""Id"" order=""4""><Color red=""187"" green=""239"" blue=""196"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIa"" label=""IIa"" order=""5""><Color red=""158"" green=""145"" blue=""50"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIb"" label=""IIb"" order=""6""><Color red=""239"" green=""250"" blue=""176"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIc"" label=""IIc"" order=""7""><Color red=""239"" green=""250"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IId"" label=""IId"" order=""8""><Color red=""166"" green=""197"" blue=""11"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIe"" label=""IIe"" order=""9""><Color red=""108"" green=""99"" blue=""34"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIf"" label=""IIf"" order=""10""><Color red=""214"" green=""194"" blue=""158"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIg"" label=""IIg"" order=""11""><Color red=""178"" green=""142"" blue=""76"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIh"" label=""IIh"" order=""12""><Color red=""175"" green=""113"" blue=""51"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIa"" label=""IIIa"" order=""13""><Color red=""245"" green=""153"" blue=""77"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIb"" label=""IIIb"" order=""14""><Color red=""232"" green=""113"" blue=""14"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIc"" label=""IIIc"" order=""15""><Color red=""189"" green=""92"" blue=""11"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIId"" label=""IIId"" order=""16""><Color red=""249"" green=""208"" blue=""153"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIe"" label=""IIIe"" order=""17""><Color red=""246"" green=""99"" blue=""8"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIf"" label=""IIIf"" order=""18""><Color red=""251"" green=""180"" blue=""137"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIg"" label=""IIIg"" order=""19""><Color red=""207"" green=""136"" blue=""117"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVa"" label=""IVa"" order=""20""><Color red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVb"" label=""IVb"" order=""21""><Color red=""243"" green=""150"" blue=""141"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVc"" label=""IVc"" order=""22""><Color red=""190"" green=""93"" blue=""62"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVd"" label=""IVd"" order=""23""><Color red=""226"" green=""96"" blue=""96"" /></Labels><Labels value=""V"" label=""V"" order=""24""><Color red=""220"" green=""48"" blue=""220"" /></Labels></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>"|1|12/29/2011 07:52:58|"No Aggregation Necessary"||1|"Choice"
8|"Soil Rutting Hazard"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"The ratings in this interpretation indicate the hazard of surface rut formation through the operation of forestland equipment. Soil displacement and puddling (soil deformation and compaction) may occur simultaneously with rutting.

Ratings are based on depth to a water table, rock fragments on or below the surface, the Unified classification of the soil, depth to a restrictive layer, and slope. The hazard is described as slight, moderate, or severe. A rating of ""slight"" indicates that the soil is subject to little or no rutting. ""Moderate"" indicates that rutting is likely. ""Severe"" indicates that ruts form readily.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the specified aspect of forestland management (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

10|"Potential for Damage by Fire"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"The ratings in this interpretation indicate the potential for damage to nutrient, physical, and biotic soil characteristics by fire. The ratings involve an evaluation of the potential impact of prescribed fires or wildfires that are intense enough to remove the duff layer and consume organic matter in the surface layer.

The ratings are based on texture of the surface layer, content of rock fragments and organic matter in the surface layer, thickness of the surface layer, and slope. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. The soils are described as having a ""low,"" ""moderate,"" or ""high"" potential for this kind of damage. ""Low"" indicates that fire damage is unlikely. Good performance can be expected, and little or no maintenance is needed. ""Moderate"" indicates that fire damage can occur because one or more soil properties are less than desirable. Fair performance can be expected, and some maintenance is needed. ""High"" indicates that fire damage can occur because of one or more soil properties and that overcoming the unfavorable properties requires special design, extra maintenance, and costly alteration.

Metal or wooden posts are used when the fences are built. This interpretation is applicable where the posts are set to a depth of 24 inches or less in the soil and strands of wire are suspended between the posts.

Ratings are based on the ease of setting posts in the soil, the ease of maintaining the wire tension, and the estimated replacement and maintenance costs. Excavations for wooden posts are made by power augers or are hand dug. Metal posts are driven into the soil.
 
Depth to bedrock or a cemented pan and the content of large and small stones influence the excavation of postholes and the driving of posts. Flooding and the depth to a seasonal high water table may restrict the season of construction. Flooding also increases maintenance and replacement costs. High water tables increase maintenance costs and require deeper post settings. In areas of soils that have a high shrink-swell potential, deep post settings or rock jacks are needed to maintain vertical post alignment. Setting the posts in permanently frozen soil may result in loss of the insulation qualities of the soil and in thermokarst topography. In areas of sandy soils, aligning the posts and maintaining the desired wire tension commonly are difficult because of low soil strength. Soil blowing causes maintenance problems. Frost action results in frost heaving of the posts. Steep slopes restrict the use of power augers and the delivery of supplies. On steep slopes, surface creep during wet periods increases maintenance costs. Soil reaction and salinity affect the type of post selected and increase maintenance costs.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Ratings are based on the ease of setting posts in the soil, the ease of maintaining the wire tension, and the estimated replacement and maintenance costs. Excavations for wooden posts are made by power augers or are hand dug. Metal posts are driven into the soil.
 
Depth to bedrock or a cemented pan and the content of large and small stones influence the excavation of postholes and the driving of posts. Flooding and the depth to a seasonal high water table may restrict the season of construction. Flooding also increases maintenance and replacement costs. High water tables increase maintenance costs and require deeper post settings. In areas of soils that have a high shrink-swell potential, deep post settings or rock jacks are needed to maintain vertical post alignment. Setting the posts in permanently frozen soil may result in loss of the insulation qualities of the soil and in thermokarst topography. In areas of sandy soils, aligning the posts and maintaining the desired wire tension commonly are difficult because of low soil strength. Soil blowing causes maintenance problems. Frost action results in frost heaving of the posts. Steep slopes restrict the use of power augers and the delivery of supplies. On steep slopes, surface creep during wet periods increases maintenance costs. Soil reaction and salinity affect the type of post selected and increase maintenance costs.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

78|"Disposal of Wastewater by Irrigation"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Wastewater includes municipal and food-processing wastewater and effluent from lagoons or storage ponds. Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality. It contains domestic waste and may contain industrial waste. It may have received primary or secondary treatment. It is rarely untreated sewage. Food-processing wastewater results from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption. In places it is high in content of sodium and chloride. The effluent in lagoons and storage ponds is from facilities used to treat or store food-processing wastewater or domestic or animal waste. Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from the facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in content of carbonaceous and nitrogenous material; the content of nitrogen commonly ranges from 10 to 30 milligrams per liter. The wastewater from animal waste treatment lagoons or storage ponds, however, has much higher concentrations of these materials, mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as the domestic waste. The content of nitrogen in this wastewater generally ranges from 50 to 2,000 milligrams per liter. When wastewater is applied, checks should be made to ensure that nitrogen, heavy metals, and salts are not added in excessive amounts.

Disposal of wastewater by irrigation not only disposes of municipal wastewater and wastewater from food-processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds but also can improve crop production by increasing the amount of water available to crops. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the design, construction, management, and performance of the irrigation system. The properties that affect design and management include the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to a water table, ponding, available water capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), slope, and flooding. The properties that affect construction include stones, cobbles, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, and ponding. The properties that affect performance include depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, bulk density, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, reaction, and the cation-exchange capacity, which is used to estimate the capacity of a soil to adsorb heavy metals. Permanently frozen soils are not suitable for disposal of wastewater by irrigation.

57|"Disposal of Wastewater by Rapid Infiltration"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Rapid infiltration of wastewater is a process in which wastewater applied in a level basin at a rate of 4 to 120 inches per week percolates through the soil. The wastewater may eventually reach the ground water. The application rate commonly exceeds the rate needed for irrigation of cropland. Vegetation is not a necessary part of the treatment; thus, the basins may or may not be vegetated. The thickness of the soil material needed for proper treatment of the wastewater is more than 72 inches. As a result, geologic and hydrologic investigation is needed to ensure proper design and performance and to determine the risk of ground-water pollution.

The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

Sprinkler irrigation systems apply irrigation water to a field through a series of pipes and nozzles and can be either solid set or mobile.  Generally, this type of irrigation system is suitable for small grains, row crops, vegetables, and orchards. 

The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of sprinkler irrigation systems are depth, available water holding capacity, sodium adsorption ratio, surface coarse fragments, saturated hydraulic conductivity, salinity, slope, wetness, and flooding. The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are surface rocks, salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, wetness, and available water holding capacity.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the interpretation. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by the soil features that affect the soil interpretation.  Verbal soil rating classes are based on the highest numerical rating for the most limiting soil feature(s) considered in the rating process.  ""Not limited"" (numerical value for the most restrictive feature = 0.00) indicates that the soil has no limiting features for the specified use.  ""Somewhat limited"" (numerical value for the most restrictive feature =.01 to .99) indicates that the soil has limiting features for the specified use that can be overcome with proper planning, design, installation, and management.  The effort required to overcome a soil limitation increases as the numerical rating increases.  ""Very limited"" (numerical value for the most restrictive feature = 1.00) indicates that the soil has one or more very limiting features that can only be overcome with special planning, major soil modification, special design, or significant management practices.

Lesser soil restrictive features have a lower numerical value than the maximum used to rate the soil, and they are identified to provide the user with additional information about soil limitations for the specific use.  Lesser soil restrictive features also need to be considered in planning, design, installation, and management.

514|"Storm Water Management - Infiltration (NY)"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Proper management of storm water runoff from construction sites and developed areas is an issue of growing importance in New York State. During construction, exposed soil is subject to a greater risk of erosion, resulting in a greater potential for sedimentation in waterways. Storm water runoff increases on the rooftops of buildings, paved parking lots, and other impervious surfaces and thus increases the potential for flooding and discharge of polluted runoff into open water. Management of storm water runoff can prevent or reduce the availability, release, or transport of substances that can degrade surface and ground waters. Guidelines and design criteria for storm water management practices have been established by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (2008).

This interpretation is designed to evaluate the limitations of soils for storm water management through infiltration practices. Infiltration practices collect storm water runoff in basins (or trenches) for storage prior to filtration through undisturbed soil in the basin (or trench) floor and sides. Deep, well drained, and permeable soils are required for installation of infiltration practices. The purpose of this interpretation is to help decision makers use soil survey information in the selection and implementation of the storm water management practices best suited to a particular location. The information in this interpretation is intended for planning purposes and does not eliminate the need for onsite investigation of the soil.

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by the soil features that influence the design, construction, and performance of infiltration practices. ""Least limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified practice. Good performance and low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the practice. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or construction. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Most limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the practice. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive construction procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

The rating class is based on the maximum value of the rating indices generated for all soil features considered. Where the rating value is:

        equal to 0.0, the rating class is ""least limited.""
        > 0.0 and < 1.0, the rating class is ""somewhat limited.""
        equal to 1.0, the rating class is ""most limited.""

Design criteria in the ""New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual"" (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation) were used to guide selection of potentially limiting soil properties. Additional limiting features incorporated into the interpretation are based on soil function for the specific practice. Following is a synopsis of the soil features considered in this interpretation.

Excessive permeability: Excessive permeability in one or more layers may allow storm water to move rapidly through the soil without sufficient filtering, resulting in a potential for ground-water contamination. Additional pretreatment or soil amendments may be required as part of an infiltration practice. The interpretation evaluates the range (low to high) of permeability values for the most transmissive layer in the soil. Where ""excessive permability"" is:

        > 7.5 in/hr, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        >= 5.0 in/hr and <= 7.5 in/hr, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        < 5.0 in/hr, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Low permeability: Low permeability restricts movement of water through the soil, impeding the infiltration function. The interpretation evaluates the range (low to high) of permeability values for the least transmissive layer in the soil. Where ""low permeability"" is:

        < 0.5 in/hr, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        >= 0.5 in/hr and <= 1.0 in/hr, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        > 1.0 in/hr, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.
	
Slope gradient: Excessive slope limits the functionality of an infiltration practice. The representative slope gradient percent for the soil component is the property evaluated. Where ""slope gradient"" is:

        > 15 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        > 8 percent and <= 15 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        <= 8 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Depth to bedrock: Limited depth to bedrock impedes excavation and restricts infiltration. The minimum depth to bedrock is the property evaluated. Where ""depth to bedrock"" is:

        < 36 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        >= 36 inches and <= 48 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        > 48 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Depth to human-manufactured materials: In urban areas, some anthropogenic (human-altered) soils have a restrictive layer, such as pavement, below the surface. Limited depth to this feature impedes excavation and restricts infiltration. The minimum depth to human-manufactured materials is the property evaluated. Where ""depth to human-manufactured materials"" is:

        < 36 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        >= 36 inches and <= 48 inches, the rating value is expressed at the number 0.5.
        > 48 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Depth to saturation:  A seasonal high water table in the upper part of the soil limits the storage capacity of an infiltration practice. The interpretation evaluates the minimum depth to a zone of saturation. Where the ""depth to saturation"" is:

        < 36 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        >= 36 inches and <= 48 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        > 48 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Excessive fines: Soils with a high content of silt and clay may become plugged with sediment from storm water, resulting in restricted infiltration. The interpretation evaluates the weighted average of the range (low to high values) of the percent passing the number 200 sieve, for depths > 36 inches, as follows:

        all of range >= 40, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.		
        some of range >= 40, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.		
        all of range < 40, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.		

In addition soil characteristics, other attributes of the site and the surrounding area are important factors in planning and implementing storm water management practices. For example, proximity and slope direction from the installation practice to a drinking water well are important considerations when sites for infiltration practices are selected.

The components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen, which is displayed in the report. An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as the one listed for the map unit. The percent composition of these components is described. As a result, the percentage of the rating class in the map unit is indicated.


Other components with different ratings may occur in each map unit. The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the Selected Soil Interpretations report with this interpretation included from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey or from the Soil Data Mart.

515|"Storm Water Management - Ponds (NY)"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Proper management of storm water runoff from construction sites and developed areas is an issue of growing importance in New York State. During construction, exposed soil is subject to a greater risk of erosion, resulting in a greater potential for sedimentation in waterways. Storm water runoff increases on the rooftops of buildings, paved parking lots, and other impervious surfaces and thus increases the potential for flooding and discharge of polluted runoff into open water. Management of storm water runoff can prevent or reduce the availability, release, or transport of substances that can degrade surface and ground waters. Guidelines and design criteria for storm water management practices have been established by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (2008).

This interpretation is designed to evaluate the limitations of soils for storm water management ponds (excluding small ""pocket ponds""). Although designs vary, most storm water ponds are excavated, have a dam with a spillway, a separate forebay area, and a permanent pool 4 to 6 feet deep. Such designs detain storm water for a number of days to a few weeks, allowing pollutants to settle out while aiding biological uptake of nutrients. The purpose of this interpretation is to help decision makers use soil survey information in the selection and implementation of the storm water management practices best suited to a particular location. The information in this interpretation is intended for planning purposes and does not eliminate the need for onsite investigation of the soil.

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by the soil features that influence the design, construction, and performance of the ponds. ""Least limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the ponds. Good performance and low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the ponds. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or construction. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Most limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the ponds. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive construction procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

The rating class is based on the maximum value of the rating indices generated for all soil features considered. Where the rating value is:

        equal to 0.0, the rating class is ""least limited.""
        > 0.0 and < 1.0, the rating class is ""somewhat limited.""
        equal to 1.0, the rating class is ""most limited.""
 
Design criteria in the ""New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual"" (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 2008) were used to guide the selection of potentially limiting soil properties. Additional limiting features incorporated into the interpretation are based on soil function for the specific practice. Following is a synopsis of the soil features considered in this interpretation.

Permeability: Excessive permeability limits the capability of the soil to retain water. The interpretation evaluates the representative permeability in the least transmissive layer (minimum) and the bottom layer, excluding bedrock. The threshold rate of 1.42 in/hr corresponds to a threshold for Hydrologic Soil Group A. Where ""permeability"" is:

        > 1.42 in/hr throughout the soil, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        > 1.42 in/hr in the bottom layer, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.9.
        < 1.42 in/hr in the minimum and bottom layers, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0

Slope gradient: Excessive slope reduces the feasibility of constructing a pond. The representative slope gradient percent for the soil component is the property evaluated. Where ""slope gradient"" is:

        > 15 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        > 8 percent and <= 15 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.9.
        > 5 percent and <= 8 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        <= 5 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Depth to bedrock: Limited depth to bedrock impedes excavation and construction of the pond. Minimum depth to bedrock is the property evaluated.

The severity of the depth limitation increases as slope gradient increases, since the bedrock impedes grading and shaping of the land. The interpretation also evaluates slope gradient percent in conjunction with depth to bedrock. Where ""depth to bedrock"" is:

        < 20 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        >= 20 inches and < 40 inches and slope is > 3 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        >= 20 inches and < 40 inches and slope is <= 3 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.8.
        >= 40 inches and < 60 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        >= 60 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Depth to human-manufactured materials: In urban areas, some anthropogenic (human-altered) soils have a restrictive layer, such as pavement, below the surface. Limited depth to this restriction impedes excavation and construction of the pond. The minimum depth to human-manufactured materials is the property evaluated.

The severity of the depth limitation increases as slope gradient increases, since the pavement or other restriction impedes grading and shaping of the land. The interpretation also evaluates slope gradient percent in conjunction with depth to human-manufactured materials. Where ""depth to human-manufactured materials"" is:

        < 20 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        >= 20 inches and < 40 inches and slope is > 3 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        >= 20 inches and < 40 inches and slope is <= 3 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.8.
        >= 40 inches and <= 60 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        >= 60 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Flooding: Flooding limits the storage capacity of  the pond  and may degrade the quality of the site. The interpretation evaluates the flooding frequency of the soil. Where ""flooding"" is:

        frequent (> 50 % chance in any year or more than 50 times in 100 years), the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        occasional (5 to 50 % chance in any year or 5 to 50 times in 100 years), the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        rare (1 to 5 % chance in any year or 1 to 5 times in 100 years), the rating value is expressed as the number 0.2.
        none or very rare, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Depth to saturation: A seasonal high water table at the surface of the soil limits the storage capacity of  the pond. The interpretation evaluates the minimum depth to a zone of saturation. Where the ""depth to saturation"" is:

        equal to 0 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        > 0 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

In addition of soil characteristics, other attributes of the site and the surrounding area are important factors in planning and implementing storm water ponds. For example, an increase in the runoff-generating potential and size of a contributing area upslope from the proposed pond site generally increases the size of the required area with suitable soils for constructing the storm water pond.

The components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen, which is displayed in the report. An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as the one listed for the map unit. The percent composition of these components is described. As a result, the percentage of the rating class in the map unit is indicated.


Other components with different ratings may occur in each map unit. The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the Selected Soil Interpretations report with this interpretation included from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey or from the Soil Data Mart.

516|"Storm Water Management - Wetlands (NY)"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Proper management of storm water runoff from construction sites and developed areas is an issue of growing importance in New York State. During construction, exposed soil is subject to a greater risk of erosion, resulting in a greater potential for sedimentation in waterways. Storm water runoff increases on the rooftops of buildings, paved parking lots, and other impervious surfaces and thus increases the potential for flooding and discharge of polluted runoff into open water. Management of storm water runoff can prevent or reduce the availability, release, or transport of substances that can degrade surface and ground waters. Guidelines and design criteria for storm water management practices have been established by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (2008).

This interpretation is designed to evaluate the limitations of soils for storm water management wetlands. These are constructed, shallow-water areas designed to simulate the water quality improvement function of natural wetlands, as a stand-alone practice or as the downstream component of related practices, such as storm water ponds or infiltration basins. The purpose of this interpretation is to help decision makers use soil survey information in the selection and implementation of the storm water management practices best suited to a particular location. The information in this interpretation is intended for planning purposes and does not eliminate the need for onsite investigation of the soil.

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by the soil features that influence the design, construction, and performance of storm water management wetlands.  ""Least limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for this practice. Good performance and low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the practice. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or construction. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Most limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the practice. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive construction procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

The rating class is based on the maximum value of the rating indices generated for each soil feature considered. Where the rating value is:

        equal to 0.0, the rating class is ""least limited.""
        > 0 and < 1.0, the rating class is ""somewhat limited.""
        equal to 1.0, the rating class is ""most limited.""

Design criteria in the ""New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual"" (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 2008) were used to guide the selection of potentially limiting soil properties. Additional limiting features incorporated into the interpretation are based on soil function for the specific practice. Following is a synopsis of the soil features considered in this interpretation.

Permeability: Excessive permeability limits the capability of the soil to retain water. The interpretation evaluates the representative permeability in the least transmissive layer (minimum) and the bottom layer, excluding bedrock. The threshold rate of 1.42 in/hr corresponds to a threshold for Hydrologic Soil Group A. In some organic soils, permeability is flagged as a limitation, even though the soil is saturated for most of the year because of its low position on the landscape.

A zone of saturation in the soil partially offsets the limitation of excessive permeability. Water lost from the soil may be replenished during times of the year when the soil has a seasonal high water table. The interpretation evaluates whether a seasonal zone of saturation is within the upper 3 feet of the soil. Where ""permeability"" is:

        > 1.42 in/hr throughout the soil and depth to saturation is >= 36 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        > 1.42 in/hr throughout the soil and depth to saturation is < 36 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.8.
        > 1.42 in/hr in the bottom layer and depth to saturation is >= 36 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.9.
        > 1.42 in/hr in the bottom layer and depth to saturation is < 36 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.7.
        < 1.42 in/hr in the minimum and bottom layers, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Slope gradient: Excessive slope limits the feasibility of constructing a wetland. The representative slope gradient percent for the soil component is the property evaluated. Where ""slope gradient"" is:

        > 8 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        > 5 percent and <= 8 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.9.
        > 3 percent and <= 5 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        <= 3 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Depth to bedrock: Limited depth to bedrock impedes excavation and construction of a wetland. The minimum depth to bedrock is the property evaluated.

The severity of the depth limitation increases as slope gradient increases, since the bedrock impedes grading and shaping of the land. The interpretation also evaluates slope gradient percent in conjunction with depth to bedrock. Where ""depth to bedrock"" is:

        < 20 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        >= 20 inches and < 40 inches and slope is > 8 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        >= 20 inches and < 40 inches and slope is <= 8 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.8.
        >= 40 inches and < 60 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        >= 60 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Depth to human-manufactured materials: In urban areas, some anthropogenic (human-altered) soils have a restrictive layer, such as pavement, below the surface. Limited depth to this restriction impedes excavation and construction of a wetland. The minimum depth to human-manufactured materials is the property evaluated.

The severity of the depth limitation increases as slope gradient increases, since the pavement or other restrictive material impedes grading and shaping of the land. The interpretation also evaluates slope gradient percent in conjunction with depth to human-manufactured materials. Where ""depth to human-manufactured materials"" is:

        < 20 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        >= 20 inches and < 40 inches and slope is > 8 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        >=20 inches and < 40 inches and slope is <= 8 percent, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.8.
        >= 40 inches and < 60 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        >= 60 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Surface fragments: Large fragments on the surface, such as stones or boulders, interfere with the regrading that may be required during construction of a wetland. The interpretation evaluates the representative size and percent cover of fragments on the surface of the soil. Where the ""surface fragments"" are:

        very bouldery or extremely bouldery, the rating value is expressed as the number  0.8.
        bouldery, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.4.
        very stony or extremely stony, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.2.
        none or stony, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Flooding: Flooding interferes with the function of a wetland practice and may degrade the quality of the site. The interpretation evaluates flooding frequency of the soil. Where ""flooding"" is:

        frequent (> 50 % chance in any year or more than 50 times in 100 years), the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        occasional (5 to 50 % chance in any year or 5 to 50 times in 100 years), the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        rare (1 to 5 % chance in any year or 1 to 5 times in 100 years), the rating value is expressed as the number 0.2.
        none or very rare, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

Hydric soil: Hydric soils are saturated near the surface for extended periods during the growing season and are commonly associated with naturally existing wetlands. A hydric soil limitation flags areas that may be designated as wetlands and thus restricted from the development of storm water wetlands. The interpretation evaluates the hydric rating and the minimum depth to saturation for the soil, as follows:

        If the soil is hydric, the rating value is expressed as the number 1.0.
        If the soil is not hydric and depth to saturation is < 12 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.5.
        If the soil is not hydric and depth to saturation is >= 12 inches, the rating value is expressed as the number 0.0.

In addition to soil characteristics, other attributes of the site and the surrounding area are important factors in planning and implementing storm water management practices. For example, storm water management wetlands should not be created within areas of naturally existing wetlands, so these natural areas need to be identified to avoid their degradation. Onsite evaluation by a trained wetland scientist can verify the occurrence of wetlands and determine the boundaries between wetlands and uplands.

The  components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen, which is displayed in the report.

471|"Soil Taxonomy Classification"|"component"|"taxclname"|"String"|120||"This rating presents the taxonomic classification based on Soil Taxonomy.

The system of soil classification used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey has six categories (Soil Survey Staff, 1999 and 2003). Beginning with the broadest, these categories are the order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series. Classification is based on soil properties observed in the field or inferred from those observations or from laboratory measurements. This table shows the classification of the soils in the survey area. The categories are defined in the following paragraphs.

ORDER. Twelve soil orders are recognized. The differences among orders reflect the dominant soil-forming processes and the degree of soil formation. Each order is identified by a word ending in sol. An example is Alfisols.

SUBORDER. Each order is divided into suborders primarily on the basis of properties that influence soil genesis and are important to plant growth or properties that reflect the most important variables within the orders. The last syllable in the name of a suborder indicates the order. An example is Udalfs (Ud, meaning humid, plus alfs, from Alfisols).

GREAT GROUP. Each suborder is divided into great groups on the basis of close similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree of development of pedogenic horizons; soil moisture and temperature regimes; type of saturation; and base status. Each great group is identified by the name of a suborder and by a prefix that indicates a property of the soil. An example is Hapludalfs (Hapl, meaning minimal horizonation, plus udalfs, the suborder of the Alfisols that has a udic moisture regime).

SUBGROUP. Each great group has a typic subgroup. Other subgroups are intergrades or extragrades. The typic subgroup is the central concept of the great group; it is not necessarily the most extensive. Intergrades are transitions to other orders, suborders, or great groups. Extragrades have some properties that are not representative of the great group but do not indicate transitions to any other taxonomic class. Each subgroup is identified by one or more adjectives preceding the name of the great group. The adjective Typic identifies the subgroup that typifies the great group. An example is Typic Hapludalfs.

FAMILY. Families are established within a subgroup on the basis of physical and chemical properties and other characteristics that affect management. Generally, the properties are those of horizons below plow depth where there is much biological activity. Among the properties and characteristics considered are particle-size class, mineralogy class, cation-exchange activity class, soil temperature regime, soil depth, and reaction class. A family name consists of the name of a subgroup preceded by terms that indicate soil properties. An example is fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs.

SERIES. The series consists of soils within a family that have horizons similar in color, texture, structure, reaction, consistence, mineral and chemical composition, and arrangement in the profile.

191|"Conservation Tree and Shrub Group"|"component"|"constreeshrubgrp"|"Choice"|254||"Each tree and shrub species has certain climatic and physiographic limits. Within these parameters, trees and shrubs may be well suited or poorly suited to a given environment because of climate or site or soil characteristics. On the basis of the performance of individual species to specific conditions of soil, climate, physiography, and management, Conservation Tree and Shrub Groups (CTSGs) have been developed. Individual soils have been grouped with similar soils into one of the 10 main CTSGs. Most of these main groups are further divided into subgroups.

This interpretation provides guidance in selecting the species best suited to each of the groups of soils within each vegetative zone. It also can be used for predicting survival, height, growth, species attributes, and effectiveness and for selecting species for windbreaks, riparian plantings, recreation and wildlife plantings, and ornamental or environmental plantings.

Tree and shrub species associated with each CTSG are broken down by vegetative zones (rainfall zones). These lists are available in the local office of the USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service, or on the Web in the electronic Field Office Technical Guide. Because vegetative zones are rather large, climatic differences within a zone should be considered when species are recommended for planting. For example, some species adapted to the eastern end of a zone may be inadequately adapted to the western end. Care must be taken to ensure that conditions on individual sites are considered when species suitability and performance are determined. A case-by-case decision may be necessary to determine which CTSG is most appropriate when an individual site has characteristics that differ from those of the CTSG in which it occurs. These differences occur because of inclusions of other soils, site modifications (such as leveling and drainage manipulation), soil pH (calcareous sites), irrigation, soil amendments, or other factors."|||"Property"||||0|1|0|0||0|||-1|"ConsTSG"||||||||0||||"Centimeters"|0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|8||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""8""><ColorRampType type=""0"" name=""Random""><Values min=""50"" max=""99"" /><Saturation min=""33"" max=""66"" /><Hue start=""0"" end=""360"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""1"" label=""1"" order=""1"" /><Labels value=""1A"" label=""1A"" order=""2"" /><Labels value=""1H"" label=""1H"" order=""3"" /><Labels value=""1K"" label=""1K"" order=""4"" /><Labels value=""1KK"" label=""1KK"" order=""5"" /><Labels value=""1S"" label=""1S"" order=""6"" /><Labels value=""1SK"" label=""1SK"" order=""7"" /><Labels value=""1SKK"" label=""1SKK"" order=""8"" /><Labels value=""2"" label=""2"" order=""9"" /><Labels value=""2A"" label=""2A"" order=""10"" /><Labels value=""2H"" label=""2H"" order=""11"" /><Labels value=""2K"" label=""2K"" order=""12"" /><Labels value=""2KK"" label=""2KK"" order=""13"" /><Labels value=""3"" label=""3"" order=""14"" /><Labels value=""3A"" label=""3A"" order=""15"" /><Labels value=""4"" label=""4"" order=""16"" /><Labels value=""4A"" label=""4A"" order=""17"" /><Labels value=""4C"" label=""4C"" order=""18"" /><Labels value=""4CA"" label=""4CA"" order=""19"" /><Labels value=""4CC"" label=""4CC"" order=""20"" /><Labels value=""4CK"" label=""4CK"" order=""21"" /><Labels value=""4K"" label=""4K"" order=""22"" /><Labels value=""5"" label=""5"" order=""23"" /><Labels value=""5A"" label=""5A"" order=""24"" /><Labels value=""5K"" label=""5K"" order=""25"" /><Labels value=""5KK"" label=""5KK"" order=""26"" /><Labels value=""6"" label=""6"" order=""27"" /><Labels value=""6A"" label=""6A"" order=""28"" /><Labels value=""6D"" label=""6D"" order=""29"" /><Labels value=""6DA"" label=""6DA"" order=""30"" /><Labels value=""6DK"" label=""6DK"" order=""31"" /><Labels value=""6G"" label=""6G"" order=""32"" /><Labels value=""6GA"" label=""6GA"" order=""33"" /><Labels value=""6GK"" label=""6GK"" order=""34"" /><Labels value=""6GKK"" label=""6GKK"" order=""35"" /><Labels value=""6K"" label=""6K"" order=""36"" /><Labels value=""6KK"" label=""6KK"" order=""37"" /><Labels value=""7"" label=""7"" order=""38"" /><Labels value=""7A"" label=""7A"" order=""39"" /><Labels value=""8"" label=""8"" order=""40"" /><Labels value=""8K"" label=""8K"" order=""41"" /><Labels value=""9C"" label=""9C"" order=""42"" /><Labels value=""9L"" label=""9L"" order=""43"" /><Labels value=""9N"" label=""9N"" order=""44"" /><Labels value=""9NW"" label=""9NW"" order=""45"" /><Labels value=""9W"" label=""9W"" order=""46"" /><Labels value=""10"" label=""10"" order=""47"" /><Labels value=""Not applicable"" label=""Not applicable"" order=""48"" /></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>"|1|02/28/2007 14:15:09|"Dominant Condition"||1|"Choice"

523|"NH Forest Soil Group"|"mapunit"|"nhiforsoigrp"|"Choice"|254||"NH Forest Soil Groups (NHFSGs) consist of map units that are similar in their potential for commercial forest products, their suitability for native tree growth, and their use and management. Considered in grouping the map units are depth to bedrock, texture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, available water capacity, drainage class, and slope. The grouping applies only to soils in the State of New Hampshire.

The NHFSGs have been developed to help land users and managers in New Hampshire evaluate the relative productivity of soils and to better understand patterns of plant succession and how soil and site interactions influence management decisions. The soils are assigned to one of five groups (IA, IB, IC, IIA, and IIB). Several map units in New Hampshire either vary so greatly or have such a limited potential for commercial forest products that they have not been assigned to an NHFSG (NC). Examples of NC map units are very poorly drained soils and soils at high elevations. The kinds of tree species generally growing in climax stands in each of the five NHFSGs vary from county to county. This information is available through local NRCS field offices. 


IA--This group consists of very deep, loamy, moderately well drained or well drained soils. Generally, these soils are more fertile than other soils and have the most favorable soil moisture relationships. 

IB--The soils in this group are generally sandy or loamy over sandy material and are slightly less fertile than group IA soils.  Group IB soils are moderately well drained or well drained. Their soil moisture is adequate for good tree growth, but it may not be quite as abundant as that in group IA soils. 

IC--The soils in this group are in areas of outwash sand and gravel. They are moderately well to excessively drained. Their soil moisture is adequate for good softwood growth but is limited for hardwoods. 

IIA--This diverse group includes many of the same soils as those in groups IA and IB. The soils are separated into a unique group, however, because they have physical limitations that make forest management more difficult and costly, i.e., steep slopes, bedrock outcrops, erosive textures, surface boulders, and extreme rockiness.

625|"National Commodity Crop Productivity Index v2"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254|3|"National Commodity Crop Productivity Index is a method of arraying the soils of the United States for non-irrigated commodity crop production based on their inherent soil properties.  The rating a soil is assigned is the highest one of three basic crop group indices, which are based on the climate where the crop is typically grown.  Cooler climates are represented by winter wheat, moderate climates are represented by corn and soybeans, and warmer climates are represented by cotton.  (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_050734.pdf)

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas. Ratings are for soils in their present condition. The present land use is not considered in the ratings. 

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 feet).  Soil, site, and climate properties that influence the growth of crops are major considerations. Soil productivity is influenced by many soil properties.  An ideal soil will store adequate amounts of water to nurture the crop between rains.  This soil will have a near-neutral pH, will store nutrients, and lack toxic materials.  The soil will have no barriers, either physical or chemical, to root growth.  Water and gas transmission through the soil will be sufficient to maintain both water and oxygen at sufficient levels in the root zone.   The soil will not be saturated with water during the growing season to the point that root growth is inhibited.  The soil will not be subject to excessive flooding or ponding during the growing season.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects erosion by water, runoff, and the operation of equipment.  The climate must provide adequate water and heat to allow the desired crop to mature.  A soil that differs from the ideal in any of these features will have lower inherent productivity for a particular crop.  The further a soil differs from ideality in any one or all of the factors that determine inherent productivity, the lower its inherent productivity will be. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the estimated productivity which is determined by all of the soil, site, and climatic features that affect crop productivity. ""High inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil, site, and climate have features that are very favorable for crop production. High yields and low risk of crop failure can be expected if a high level of management is employed. ""Moderately high inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally quite favorable crop production.  Good yields and moderately low risk of crop failure can be expected. ""Moderate inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally favorable crop production.  Good yields and moderate risk of crop failure can be expected.  ""Moderately low inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally not favorable crop production.  Low yields and moderately high risk of crop failure can be expected.   ""Low inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for crop production.  Low yields and high risk of crop failure can be expected.  

Numerical ratings indicate the overall productivity of the soil. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.01. They indicate gradations between the point at which the combination of soil, site, and climate features has the greatest positive impact on inherent productivity (1.00) and the point at which the soil features are very unfavorable (0.01). 

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen. An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit. The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.  

Other components with different ratings may be present in each map unit. The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey. Onsite investigation may be needed to validate these interpretations and to confirm the identity of the soil on a given site."|||"Interpretation"|"NCCPI - National Commodity Crop Productivity Index (Ver 2.0)"|2||0|1|0|0||0|||-1|"NCCPI"||||||||0||||"Centimeters"|0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|3|5|"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""3""><ColorRampType type=""1"" name=""Progressive"" count=""3""><LowerColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><LowerColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><LowerColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><UpperColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""255"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0"" classes=""5"" /></Map_Legend>"|1|04/07/2014 09:06:46|"Weighted Average"||1|"Float"
16|"Hydric Rating by Map Unit"|"component"|"hydricrating"|"Choice"|254||"This rating indicates the percentage of map units that meets the criteria for hydric soils. Map units are composed of one or more map unit components or soil types, each of which is rated as hydric soil or not hydric. Map units that are made up dominantly of hydric soils may have small areas of minor nonhydric components in the higher positions on the landform, and map units that are made up dominantly of nonhydric soils may have small areas of minor hydric components in the lower positions on the landform. Each map unit is rated based on its respective components and the percentage of each component within the map unit. 

The thematic map is color coded based on the composition of hydric components. The five color classes are separated as 100 percent hydric components, 66 to 99 percent hydric components, 33 to 65 percent hydric components, 1 to 32 percent hydric components, and less than one percent hydric components.

In Web Soil Survey, the Summary by Map Unit table that is displayed below the map pane contains a column named 'Rating'.  In this column the percentage of each map unit that is classified as hydric is displayed.

Hydric soils are defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (NTCHS) as soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part (Federal Register, 1994). Under natural conditions, these soils are either saturated or inundated long enough during the growing season to support the growth and reproduction of hydrophytic vegetation. 

The NTCHS definition identifies general soil properties that are associated with wetness. In order to determine whether a specific soil is a hydric soil or nonhydric soil, however, more specific information, such as information about the depth and duration of the water table, is needed. Thus, criteria that identify those estimated soil properties unique to hydric soils have been established (Federal Register, 2002). These criteria are used to identify map unit components that normally are associated with wetlands. The criteria used are selected estimated soil properties that are described in ""Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) and ""Keys to Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 2006) and in the ""Soil Survey Manual"" (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993). 

If soils are wet enough for a long enough period of time to be considered hydric, they should exhibit certain properties that can be easily observed in the field. These visible properties are indicators of hydric soils. The indicators used to make onsite determinations of hydric soils are specified in ""Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States"" (Hurt and Vasilas, 2006).

AWS is reported as a single value (in centimeters) of water for the specified depth of the soil. AWS is calculated as the available water capacity times the thickness of each soil horizon to a specified depth.

A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the component. For the derivation of AWS, only the representative value for available water capacity is used.

The available water supply for each map unit component is computed as described above and then aggregated to a single value for the map unit by the process described below.

A map unit typically consists of one or more ""components."" A component is either some type of soil or some nonsoil entity, e.g., rock outcrop. For the attribute being aggregated (e.g., available water supply), the first step of the aggregation process is to derive one attribute value for each of a map unit's components. From this set of component attributes, the next step of the process is to derive a single value that represents the map unit as a whole. Once a single value for each map unit is derived, a thematic map for the map units can be generated. Aggregation is needed because map units rather than components are delineated on the soil maps.

The composition of each component in a map unit is recorded as a percentage. A composition of 60 indicates that the component typically makes up approximately 60 percent of the map unit.

For the available water supply, when a weighted average of all component values is computed, percent composition is the weighting factor."|"centimeters"|"cm"|"Property"||||1|0|0|0||1|||1|"AWS100"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|3|5|"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""3""><ColorRampType type=""1"" name=""Progressive"" count=""3""><LowerColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><LowerColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><LowerColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><UpperColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""255"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0"" classes=""5"" /></Map_Legend>"|1|02/28/2007 13:32:20|"No Aggregation Necessary"||1|"Float"

7|"Available Water Supply, 0 to 150 cm"|"muaggatt"|"aws0150wta"|"Float"||2|"Available water supply (AWS) is the total volume of water (in centimeters) that should be available to plants when the soil, inclusive of rock fragments, is at field capacity. It is commonly estimated as the amount of water held between field capacity and the wilting point, with corrections for salinity, rock fragments, and rooting depth. AWS is reported as a single value (in centimeters) of water for the specified depth of the soil. AWS is calculated as the available water capacity times the thickness of each soil horizon to a specified depth.

For each soil layer, available water capacity, used in the computation of AWS, is recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the component. For the derivation of AWS, only the representative value for available water capacity is used.

The available water supply for each map unit component is computed as described above and then aggregated to a single value for the map unit by the process described below.

A map unit typically consists of one or more ""components."" A component is either some type of soil or some nonsoil entity, e.g., rock outcrop. For the attribute being aggregated (e.g., available water supply), the first step of the aggregation process is to derive one attribute value for each of a map unit's components. From this set of component attributes, the next step of the process is to derive a single value that represents the map unit as a whole. Once a single value for each map unit is derived, a thematic map for the map units can be generated. Aggregation is needed because map units rather than components are delineated on the soil maps.

The composition of each component in a map unit is recorded as a percentage. A composition of 60 indicates that the component typically makes up approximately 60 percent of the map unit.

113|"Vehicle Trafficability, Type 1, Dry Season"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"string"|254||"Military category type 1 vehicles are lightweight and have low contact pressure (less than 2.0 pounds per square inch). For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during dry periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (one) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.  An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit.  The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.

For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during wet periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils when wet is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use

Trafficability performance was estimated for one vehicle pass. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.

For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during wet periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils when wet is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for one vehicle pass. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.  An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit.  The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.

For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during wet periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils when wet is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for one vehicle pass. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).

Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and large stones. The limitations of low Ksat and a clayey surface layer are not so severe in dry regions of the country as in other regions; however, silty soils may be more of a problem in the dry regions because they are dusty. Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and the presence of toxic materials. Soils that are subject to flooding are particularly hazardous as bivouac areas because of the danger to life and property.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect bivouac areas. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

232|"Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"""Catastrophic mortality, large animal disposal, pit,"" is a method of disposing of dead animals by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated pit. The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the pit. When the pit is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the burial pit.

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas. While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected. Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater. The risk of contamination can be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of limiting soil properties. Ratings are for soils in their present condition. The present land use is not considered in the ratings.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet). However, because pits may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water and to determine the design needed. These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources. The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata at or directly below the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations. Soils that are flooded or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate. Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit. It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits in which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour of the land.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final cover is based largely on soil texture and consistence, which determine workability when the soil is dry and when it is wet. Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses. The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that favors the growth of plants. It should not contain excess sodium or salts and should not be too acid. In comparison with other horizons, the surface layer in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter. Thus, it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled pit area.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use.

Many homes and business structures are rendered unfit for occupancy, either by destruction or contamination.  Such a landfill involves excavating a large pit or trench, placing the rubble and debris in the trench, and covering each layer with a blanket of soil material.  A final blanket of cover material is placed over the whole facility when completed.

This interpretation shows the degree and kind of limitations that affect a soil's use for such a landfill. The soil is evaluated from the surface to 79 inches.  An on-site investigation to greater depth will be needed for final site acceptance.  The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect attenuation of suspended, soil solution, and gaseous decomposition products and microorganisms; construction and maintenance of the site; and public health.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Soils that have high saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) or are shallow to bedrock, ice, a cemented pan, or stones and boulders are limited because these features interfere with the installation, performance, and maintenance of the system.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the excavation.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench or pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the ground contour.

The ease with which the trench or pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil which affect the workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect attenuation of suspended, soil solution, and gaseous decomposition products and microorganisms, construction and maintenance of the site, and public health.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Soils that have high saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) are shallow to bedrock, ice, or a cemented pan, or have a high content of stones and boulders are limited because these features interfere with the installation, performance, and maintenance of the system.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the excavation.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches which must be kept level and oriented to follow the ground contour.

Climatic factors influence the ease with which a composting facility can be maintained.  Adequate precipitation to keep the mass moist, and sufficient heat to sustain biological activity are essential.  

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Numerical ratings indicate the severity of the individual limitations.  The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00.  They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses.  ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use.  Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected of a properly designed and installed system on these soils.  ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation.  Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected.  ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use.  The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures.  Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.
