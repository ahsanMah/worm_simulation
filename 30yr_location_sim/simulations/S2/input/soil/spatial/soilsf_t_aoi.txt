"NY041"|5|"ESB"|"Escarpment, bedrock"|"A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff produced by erosion or faulting breaking the general continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces.  Exposed material is hard or soft bedrock."|"197810"
"NY041"|5|"GPI"|"Gravel pit"|"An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed, and used without crushing, as a source of sand or gravel.  Typically 3 to 40 acres."|"197811"
"NY041"|5|"GRA"|"Gravelly spot"|"Surface layer has more than 35 percent, by volume, of rock fragments that are mostly less than 3 inches in diameter.  Typically 3 to 40 acres."|"197812"
"NY041"|5|"MAR"|"Marsh or swamp"|"A water saturated, very poorly drained area, intermittently or permanently water-covered.  Marsh areas are dominantly covered by sedges, cattails, and rushes. Swamps are dominantly covered by trees or shrubs.  Not used in map units where poorly drained or very poorly drained soils are the named components.  Typically 3 to 40 acres."|"197813"
"NY041"|5|"ROC"|"Rock outcrop"|"An exposure of bedrock at the surface of the earth.  Not used where the named soils of the surrounding map unit are shallow over bedrock.  Typically 3 to 40 acres."|"197814"
"NY041"|5|"SAN"|"Sandy spot"|"Surface layer with sand content greater than 75 percent in areas where the surface layer of the named soils of the surrounding map unit have less than about 40 percent sand.  Typically 3 to 40 acres."|"197815"
"NY041"|5|"SLP"|"Short, steep slope"|"Narrow soil area that has slopes that are at least two slope classes steeper than the slope class of the surrounding map unit."|"197816"
"NY041"|5|"WET"|"Wet spot"|"Somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least 2 drainage classes wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit.  Typically 3 to 40 acres."|"197817"
