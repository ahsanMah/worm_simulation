    Description: 
      Abstract: 
        This map layer portrays the major roads in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
        Islands.  The file was produced by joining the individual State roads layers from the National 
        Highway Planning Network (NHPN), Geographic Data Technology (GDT) Dynamap, and TIGER/Line files.
        This is a revised version of the July 2012 map layer.
      Purpose: 
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large 
        regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate 
        for 1:1,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United 
        States in the use of these data.

          Roads consisting of Interstates, U.S. routes, and State routes were collected from NHPN and GDT 
          Dynamap.  In areas with a sparse road network, some roads deemed major were collected from NHPN.  
          Roads for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were collected from 2006 2nd Edition TIGER/Line 
          files.

        Process_Description:
          The data were converted to an Albers Equal Area projection.  Attribute fields for miles and 
          kilometers were added, and the values were calculated using ArcGIS.  The data were then converted 
          back to geographic coordinates.  

          Adjustments were made to the roads attribution to clarify descriptive information and to correct 
          errors.

        Process_Description:
          All the 1:1,000,000-scale map layers were checked for vertical integration.  Line positions were 
          adjusted as necessary to remove overlaps.  Wherever possible, linear features were separated 
          by 300 meters, but were kept within 500 meters of their true location.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          Data along the Canadian border were adjusted so that the Canadian and USA 1:1,000,000-scale data 
          sets can be used together as seamlessly as possible.  Problem areas were identified by Natural 
          Resources Canada (NRCan) and edits to the USA data were performed by the USGS.

          To identify problems, the National Atlas 1M roads 2012 data set was projected to the NRCan 
          working coordinate system, which is a Lambert Conformal Conic projection with standard parallels 
          of 49 and 77 degrees, datum of NAD83, an XY tolerance of 0.001 meters, and an XY resolution 
          of 0.0001 meters.  
 
          The Canadian and US data sets were displayed together and features were compared across the 
          border.  An initial set of comments and suggestions for edits were sent to the USGS by NRCan.  
          NRCan used satellite imagery for reference during the editing process by converting the 
          appropriate National Atlas 1:1,000,000-scale map layers and the 250K Canadian topo data to KML 
          and loading the KMLs into GoogleEarth.  Using the cursor coordinates in the ArcMap status bar, 
          NRCan visually navigated and correlated the ArcMap and GoogleEarth vectors.

          NRCan exported their findings and sent them to the USGS for correction and (or) further comment.  
          USGS reviewed the Canadian findings and returned the data to NRCan with comments.  The U.S. data 
          were either edited, not edited and further explanation was requested, or not edited and changes 
          were suggested to for the Canadian data.  This process was repeated until both NRCan and USGS 
          felt that the data were satisfactorily harmonized.

        Process_Description:
          Roads in the Virgin Islands that were previously identified as State routes were reattributed as 
          VI routes.  Because there is a separate Ferries data set available from the National Atlas, 
          ferries were deleted from this data set.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          Where road segments less than 0.1 KM in length were adjacent to longer segments with the same 
          attributes, the segments were joined.  All remaining roads less than 0.1 KM in length were 
          evaluated and were either joined to neighboring segments, or their length was adjusted to 
          greater than 0.1 KM.  The data were converted to an Albers Equal Area projection, values for 
          miles and kilometers were calculated using ArcGIS, and the data were converted back to geographic 
          coordinates.

          There were several roads that needed a directional prefix added; the prefixes were obtained from 
          the TIGER and NTAD sources.
